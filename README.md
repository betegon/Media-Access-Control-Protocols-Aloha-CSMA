# Media Access Control Protocols

Set of mechanisms and communication protocols through which several "interlocutors" (devices in a network, such as computers, mobile phones, etc..) agree to share a common transmission medium. This is generally electrical cable or optical fiber, or in wireless communications the frequency range assigned to the system.

## Structure

The repository is divided in two exercises:

*    finite-user slotted ALOHA protocol
	*	Utilize Matlab to analyze the probability of 0,1,..M users in Backlog state.
        *	Portray each state probabilities and calculate the System average values of Throughput,S, and Delay, D.
        *	Study of Capture Effect for the system when backlog transmit probability is small (<<1).

*    Analysis of CSMA/CA systems performance in saturation conditions.
	*	Analyze Giuseppe Bianchi proposal and obtain similar results.
